# Defines all supported flow fields.
# Format:   key (mandatory):    list of field names which form the flow key (identifier of logically similar communication,
#                               e.g., typically IP addresses of client and server + network protocol + L4 port numbers)
#           fields (mandatory):
#                   <name> (mandatory):
#                       type:      int/string/list/dict (mandatory)
#                       direction: "always" - present in both directions, "any" - present in at least one direction, "forward" - present in forward flow only, "reverse" - present in reverse flow only (mandatory)
#                       reverse:   name of a field which is paired to this field, only in the opposite direction (e.g., packets: packets@rev, src_ip: dst_ip, ...) (optional)
#                       subfields: subfields to this field (consider this field as a meta-field without any value) (optional)
#                           <name>:
#                               type:
#                               direction:
#                               reverse:
#                               subfields:
#                           ...
#
# It is not necessary to name fields in the reverse direction. Those are created automatically.
